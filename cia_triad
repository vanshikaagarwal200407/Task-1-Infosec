The CIA triad is a foundational model in information security that stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.​

Confidentiality means ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals or systems. This is achieved through measures like encryption, access controls, 
  and authentication.​
  Examples: Encryption, access controls, user authentication.

Integrity ensures that data is accurate, complete, and trustworthy, and has not been altered by unauthorized parties. Techniques like hashing and digital signatures help maintain data integrity.​
Examples: Hashing, digital signatures, version control, backup/recovery.
  
Availability guarantees that information and systems are accessible and usable by authorized users whenever needed. This involves maintaining reliable hardware, 
network connections, and protection against denial-of-service attacks.​
  Examples: Redundancy, disaster recovery plans, load balancing. 
Importance
Framework for Security: Provides a comprehensive checklist for assessing security posture and identifying gaps.
Risk Management: Helps organizations prioritize security efforts and implement effective controls.
Balance: Recognizes that these principles can sometimes conflict (e.g., strong confidentiality might hinder availability), requiring a tailored balance for unique business needs.
